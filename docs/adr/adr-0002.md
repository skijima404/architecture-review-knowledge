# ADR-0002: Edge Naming for Roll-up and Backcasting Relationships in GraphDB

## Status
Accepted

## Context
As part of the architecture review knowledge project, a Failure Backcasting Map is being translated into a graph-based model. The structure consists of three main node types—Success Criteria, Symptom, and Root Cause—each representing distinct layers of failure analysis.

In order to support both forward (Roll-up) and backward (Backcasting) reasoning over these causal relationships, a consistent and directional naming convention for edges is required in GraphDB.

## Decision

### Node Types
- `Success Criteria` (red): Desired architectural outcomes
- `Symptom` (yellow): Observable indicators of failure or risk
- `Root Cause` (blue): Underlying issues that trigger symptoms

### Relationship Definitions

Each edge definition is categorized by its causal direction:

#### Roll-up Relationships (Forward Causality: from causes to consequences)

| From        | To              | GraphDB Edge Label |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Root Cause  | Symptom         | `triggers`          |
| Symptom     | Symptom         | `triggers`          |
| Symptom     | Success Criteria| `threatens`         |
| Root Cause  | Root Cause      | `leads_to`          |

These labels represent active, cause-to-effect relationships and are suitable for upward traversal (from underlying issues toward impacted goals).

#### Backcasting Relationships (Reverse Explanation: from effects to underlying causes)

| From              | To        | GraphDB Edge Label |
|-------------------|-----------|--------------------|
| Success Criteria  | Symptom   | `threatened_by`    |
| Symptom           | Symptom   | `triggered_by`     |
| Symptom           | Root Cause| `triggered_by`     |
| Root Cause        | Root Cause| `leads_from`       |

These passive-form edge names allow backward traversal and reasoning from outcomes to their root causes.

By defining both sets of edge labels, the graph structure can support bidirectional causal analysis.

## Considered Alternatives
- Using compound or prefixed edge labels (e.g., `triggers_rc_sy`, `triggers_sy_sy`) for type-specific clarity.  
  Rejected due to verbosity and reduced generality.

## Consequences
- Enables clear semantic differentiation between forward (Roll-up) and backward (Backcasting) traversal.
- Facilitates both reasoning styles in GraphDB queries and visualizations.
- Serves as a foundation for future extensions to additional node types or relationship kinds.
