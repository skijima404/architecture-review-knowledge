# ADR-0001: Dependency Relationship Rules for Architecture Graph

## Status
Accepted

## Context
In our architecture review knowledge base, files are categorized into the following types:
- `sc-xxx`: Success Criteria
- `rf-xxx`: Symptom
- `rc-xxx`: Root Cause

These files declare interdependencies via YAML front matter fields, which are parsed to construct a knowledge graph. Clarity of these relationships is critical for both automated reasoning (e.g., ChatGPT queries) and human understanding.

## Decision
We define and normalize the following dependency relationships:

### For Root Cause (rc-xxx)
- `caused_by`: Points to other `rc-xxx` files that explain this root cause.
- `triggers_symptoms`: Points to `rf-xxx` files that are consequences of this root cause.
- `triggers_root_causes`: Points to other `rc-xxx` files that are downstream effects.

### For Symptom (rf-xxx)
- `explained_by`: Points to `rc-xxx` files that explain this symptom.
- `explained_by_symptom`: Points to `rf-xxx` files that precede or cause this symptom.

### For Success Criteria (sc-xxx)
- `threatened_by`: Points to `rf-xxx` files that potentially endanger the success criteria.
- `related_success_criteria`: Points to `sc-xxx` files that are related or affected.

### Phase Metadata (All Types)
- `observed_in_phase`: Indicates the project phase where the issue was observed.
- `introduced_in_phase`: Indicates when the issue was introduced.
- `reviewable_in_phase`: Indicates when the item should be reviewed.

## Consequences
- This schema enables consistent parsing and graph generation.
- ChatGPT or other analysis tools can query from any node and trace both upstream causes and downstream effects.
- Educational use cases can query by phase and examine cause-effect chains across artifacts.
