# ADR-0003: Relationship Key and Label Handling Policy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

When managing GraphDB relationship data, we use a two-step import process:
1. YAML metadata in markdown files is parsed into a CSV intermediary file.
2. The CSV is imported into the graph database.

To ensure consistency, maintainability, and reduced cognitive overhead during debugging and troubleshooting, we define a clear separation of responsibilities in how relationship labels are handled.

## Decision

- **Parsing scripts (e.g., `parse_*.py`) must not alter the relationship names.**
  - The `relation` field in the CSV output must reflect the original YAML key from the markdown file.
  - This ensures traceability and minimizes confusion during debugging.
- **Import scripts (e.g., `import_*.py`) are responsible for converting YAML-style relationship keys into proper GraphDB edge labels.**
  - This includes converting plural YAML keys into natural-language-style, singular GraphDB edge labels if needed (e.g., `triggers_root_causes` â†’ `LEADS_TO`).
- **Intermediate CSV files are treated as internal artifacts and may retain pluralized or non-GraphDB-compliant keys.**
  - This is intentional and avoids premature transformation that might obfuscate debugging.

## Consequences

- Edge label conversion logic is centralized in one place (the import scripts), simplifying future maintenance and modifications.
- CSVs will remain YAML-compliant and directly traceable to their source markdown files.
- Errors and mismatches can be debugged more easily because the transformation process is explicit and staged.
