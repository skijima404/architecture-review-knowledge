## Description
Key architectural elements—such as principles, target models, or transition strategies—were not included in the design documentation or artifacts. As a result, downstream teams proceeded without incorporating essential architectural direction.

## Context
This issue commonly arises when architectural knowledge is siloed or shared informally. Documentation practices may be immature, or design activities may happen under tight deadlines without architectural oversight.

## Impact
Exclusion of important architecture content in design leads to inconsistency and divergence from the intended architecture. Teams may unknowingly make decisions that contradict the architecture vision or violate core principles.

## Preventive Measures
- Include architectural components as required sections in design templates.
- Institute mandatory architecture design reviews that verify inclusion of key elements.
- Maintain centralized architecture documentation with version control and team visibility.
- Encourage collaborative design sessions that explicitly reference architecture artifacts.
