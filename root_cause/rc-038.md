## Description
Non-functional requirements (NFRs) such as performance, availability, operability, or scalability were not explicitly defined or documented. As a result, architectural decisions lacked clear targets and constraints to guide trade-offs.

## Context
This issue often arises when architectural scoping focuses heavily on functionality while neglecting qualities critical to long-term system viability. Stakeholders may assume implicit expectations, leading to misalignment in design intent.

## Impact
Without defined NFRs, implementation teams make assumptions or defer decisions, increasing the likelihood of misalignment with architecture principles and vision. This can result in later rework, performance issues, or operational fragility.

## Preventive Measures
- Require NFRs to be captured during the early architecture definition phase.
- Include NFR coverage in architecture review checklists.
- Make NFRs traceable to design decisions and testable through reviewable criteria.
- Involve operational stakeholders early to identify non-functional expectations.
