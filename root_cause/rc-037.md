## Description
The implementation process failed to consistently align with architectural objectives and models. Decisions made during development were not validated against the architectural vision, leading to design drift.

## Context
This often occurs in agile or parallel delivery contexts where architectural guidance is insufficiently embedded in team workflows. Lack of governance, absent architecture representatives, or fragmented responsibilities can contribute to the misalignment.

## Impact
Architectural drift results in systems that violate intended structure, cross-cutting concerns, or design principles. This may lead to operational inefficiencies, increased integration complexity, or a loss of long-term maintainability.

## Preventive Measures
- Establish architectural alignment checkpoints throughout the implementation phase.
- Assign architectural ownership at team level (e.g., feature team architect).
- Incorporate architecture review criteria into definition of done.
- Use architectural traceability techniques to surface divergence early.
