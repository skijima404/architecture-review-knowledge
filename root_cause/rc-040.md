## Description
The architecture vision attempted to encompass too many conflicting goals or concerns simultaneously. As a result, it became vague, unfocused, and difficult to apply in design and trade-off decisions.

## Context
This issue arises when stakeholders contribute divergent expectations into the vision without prioritization. The resulting vision may include goals that are mutually exclusive or overly aspirational without a delivery strategy.

## Impact
Architects and designers are left without clear guidance on what to prioritize. Trade-off decisions become arbitrary or contradictory, leading to misalignment between implementation and intended outcomes.

## Preventive Measures
- Facilitate early vision refinement sessions with clear prioritization of concerns.
- Use architecture decision records (ADRs) to document trade-offs and exclusions.
- Align the vision with concrete, measurable goals.
- Establish governance to evolve the vision iteratively based on feasibility assessments.
