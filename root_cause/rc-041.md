## Description
The project lacked a clearly defined data migration approach, particularly one that accounted for risks associated with migrating production data. This omission resulted in fragile or ad hoc handling of sensitive or critical datasets.

## Context
Data migration is often considered late in the project or treated as a purely technical task. In many cases, it is executed without test coverage, dry runs, or rollback planning. This is exacerbated when the architecture does not allocate resources or process to migration planning.  
This risk increases especially when adopting a new architectural style or platform, where unfamiliar failure modes may emerge. In such cases, contingency techniques like dark launches or canary releases may be necessary to observe production behavior safely.

## Impact
Without a defined and validated approach, data migration may lead to inconsistencies, loss, or corruption of production data. These issues typically surface during go-live and result in severe operational impact.

## Preventive Measures
- Define the data migration strategy during the architecture design phase (Phase C).
- Conduct dry-run migrations using representative test data and staging environments.
- Incorporate data rollback plans and validation mechanisms.
- Include migration scenarios in test plans and architectural risk assessments.
- Consider techniques such as dark launches or canary releases when adopting new architectures, to safely validate data and system behavior in production.
