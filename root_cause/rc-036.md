## Description
Design assets such as architecture principles, target models, or key decisions were not actively referenced during the detailed implementation design phase. This resulted in local decisions diverging from architectural intent.

## Context
This typically occurs when documentation is not integrated into the delivery team's workflows, or when design reviews focus only on technical feasibility rather than alignment. Time pressure or unclear ownership of architecture documents can exacerbate the problem.

## Impact
Local implementation deviates from the intended architecture, leading to misalignment with architectural principles and vision. This may manifest as inconsistent patterns, duplicated logic, or violations of cross-cutting concerns.

## Preventive Measures
- Require design reviews to explicitly verify alignment with architecture documents.
- Include architectural checkpoints in implementation phase gates.
- Automate reference checks using traceability tooling or doc linking.
- Assign responsibility for architecture consistency to a lead engineer or architect embedded in the implementation team.
